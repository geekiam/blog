A key aspect of becoming a Sovereign Individual is to take control of your finances and to ensure you are not reliant on
any third party to manage your finances.  This is one of the key reasons why I am a huge advocate of Bitcoin
and the Bitcoin network.  Bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer, censorship-resistant, immutable, and open-source
digital currency.  It is a digital currency that is not controlled by any government or central bank.

For Bitcoin function reliably and securely, it depends on the voluntary cooperation of thousands of individuals around the 
globe. Nodes, which make up the bitcoin network and verify transactions and blocks, play a key role in this effort. 

For truly sovereign Individuals, there are many benefits to considerâ€”both personally and for the security and 
resiliency of the bitcoin ecosystem.

## What is a Bitcoin Node?

A Bitcoin node is essentially computer that connects to the Bitcoin network, to help maintain a full copy of the blockchain, and relays
new transactions and blocks to other nodes.  Nodes form the backbone of the Bitcoin network, and are responsible for
validating transactions and blocks, and relaying them to other nodes, helping to keep the network secure by rejecting 
invalid transactions and blocks, and by relaying valid transactions.
