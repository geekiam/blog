Despite being originally published 20+ years ago, this book still provides valuable insights into how to benefit 
from the digital transformation.

The thesis of this book became remarkably relevant in 2020 and beyond. The authors provide a backdrop for societal 
changes that are currently in flight. These are changes impacting your life whether you realize it or not, 
primarily due to the nature of the societal changes underway, you simply cannot afford to ignore them.

The high level key takeaways from the book are:

* The internet and the global digital economy are causing industrial era nation-states to lose their power
* a new societal class structure is forming and replacing the industrial era blue collar/white collar divide
* This new class structure includes a group of people known as Sovereign Individuals; digital savvy workers capable of generating location-independent incomes
* The Sovereign Individual class will emerge as the beneficiaries of the Information Age society
* societal change is slow and modern social class structures appear to straddle both the industrial age and what will come next
* This slow change will result in rising nationalism, violent class struggles, and geopolitical conflict
* Future fortunes will favor those that prepare for this inevitable upheaval and embrace a digitally immersive future

### The Sovereign Individual

One of the most catching lines for me when starting to this book was the following:

 The cyber-economy, rather than china, could well be the greatest economic phenomenon of the next 30 years

This is rather poignant, considering the book was published in 1997, and the internet was still in its infancy.  Some 
of the most notable companies of the internet age, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and Netflix, were just
about getting started. We were still a few years away from the dot-com bubble, and the internet was still a novelty
for most people.

The next passage that really caught my attention next was :
::quote
  Weakened by the challenge of technology, the state will treat increasingly autonomous individuals, its former 
citizens, with the same ruthlessness and diplomacy is has heretofore displayed in its dealings with other governments.

The core thesis of the book is that the incumbent nation-state will be replaced by a new form of social organization, and
replaced by **Sovereign Individuals** in the Information Age. The growing ease of transferring assets electronically 
across state borders will preclude taxation. In the foreseen decentralized environment talented individuals will act 
unimpeded by external authority. 

This book, will obviously be enjoyed by those of a libertarian bent, but it is also a book that should be read by those
with anarchist tendencies. The book is a very interesting read, and it is a book that will make you think. It certainly
helped me reshape my thoughts on the future of the internet and the future of the nation-state.



### Conclusion
The one thing the book got wrong was at the end -- saying "becoming a programmer isn't necessarily the best way to 
exploit the change toward computerization" -- this was wrong, as it's a very useful skill (even if not one's primary 
role), in addition to the general problem-solving skills they advocate. I think this was just because the author isn't 
a technologist and thus doesn't appreciate the skills of programming beyond just rote coding. Otherwise, the book is 
full of excellent and highly actionable advice.
