The advancement and progress of technology has always been linked to progress, strength and survival of homo-sapiens. It 
is the ability to innovate, adapt and overcome challenges making best use of the materials and tools we have at our disposal
has always been critical in equal measure at both of survival and demise.

One of the key obstacles homo-sapiens has continually always has to overcome is the propensity to enable initially well
meaning or intended third parties to centralise the control over the advancements. Over the millennia we have allowed centralised
control to enforced over individuals and technology by fiefdoms, Chieftains, Kingdoms  Religious Institutions, Nation states
and all these concepts exhibit the same common fundamental flaws.

The belief and trust we place in third parties to think and act in our best interests, to not be overcome by their own maniacal,
egotistical delusions of grandeur and the fallacy that agreements can be reached by the concept that because a majority 
of a group think exercise is the best way to reach agreement on a subject.  We claim this process is called a
*democratic decision* 

In brief, 20th-century political structures are drowning in a 21st-century ocean of deregulated finance, autonomous 
technology, religious militancy and great-power rivalry. Meanwhile, the suppressed consequences of 20th-century 
recklessness in the once-colonised world are erupting, cracking nations into fragments and forcing populations into 
post-national solidarities: roving tribal militias, ethnic and religious sub-states and super-states. Finally, 
the old superpowers’ demolition of old ideas of international society – ideas of the “society of nations” that were 
essential to the way the new world order was envisioned after 1918 – has turned the nation-state system into a lawless 
gangland; and this is now producing a nihilistic backlash from the ones who have been most terrorised and despoiled.
