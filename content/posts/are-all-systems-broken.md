Over the past few decades there has been a lot of talk about the *system* being broken. Some may say that the system 
has never worked.  The reality the system has only ever worked for a few and is continually being used to exploit the 
many.

Over the past 2 decades it has become abundantly clear that the system is broken beyond repair now. The only way forward
is to burn it down and start again. All the ideals, traditions, beliefs, values and sensibilities that have all been used
to justify the system are now for the most part obsolete and only small percentage of the population still identify
and relate to them. 

Our systems of Government, Education, Finance, Religion, Media, Science, Medicine, Law, Politics, Business, Agriculture
have all been modified manipulated and corrupted to serve the few at the expense of the many, resulting that they now
no longer have the effects that any of the originators intended.

The United States of America (USA) provides a prime example of how the well intended ideals of the founding fathers of introducing
the Second Amendment to the Constitution has now taken a very sinister turn. The Second Amendment was introduced to protect
the young nation, in 1791, from the tyranny of a tyrannical external governments i.e. United Kingdom & France. However, in the 21st century
the citizens of the country are now being terrorised by the very government that was created to protect them, and they fear the
removal of their Second Amendment rights will lead to persecution from their own government.

The root cause of many of the problems in the world today primarily stem from governments, and the over extended reach of 
the state into the lives of its citizens. This has resulted in the *state* becoming the new religion, and the people they 
were supposedly created to serve to become the slaves.

The sole intention of the state is not to serve, but it is to drive its population further into debt and serfdom, to the benefit of
the *elite* which has been the case for thousands of years.  


### The Democracy delusion

For centuries states have tried to appease the population by offering them a concept that they choose to call *Democracy*
whereby every few years the citizens get to elect their political representatives in the vain hope that they may support 
and supposedly *fight* for their constituents. The fact is that these representatives just end up disappearing into the 
orgy of centralised planning disaster zones that are called Parliaments, and are then forced or what is commonly referred
to as *whipped* to serve the aims and whims of the *party*
