summary:  For a system to be deemed as broken, it would be safe to assume that the said system must have at some point to 
  be deemed as operational and functional. However, is that really at the point where we find ourselves, Is it now really the time that
  we all learn to blaze our own way forward with self sovereignty.

Over the past few decades there has been a lot of talk about *the system* being broken. Some may say that the system 
has never worked.  The reality the system has only ever worked for a few and is continually being used to exploit the 
many.  

Over the past 2 decades it has become abundantly clear that *the system* has always been dysfunctional. The only way forward
is to burn it down and start again. All the ideals, traditions, beliefs, values and sensibilities that have all been used
to justify *the system* are now for the most part obsolete and only small percentage of the population still identify
and relate to them. 

Our systems of Government, Education, Finance, Religion, Media, Science, Medicine, Law, Politics, Business, Agriculture
have all been modified manipulated and corrupted to serve the few at the expense of the many, resulting that they now
no longer have the effects that any of the originators intended.

A [study by IPSOS MORI in 2019](https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/global-study-nativist-populist-broken-society-britain "Majority worldwide say their society is broken ")
found that people across the world believe that the system is broken in their country.  The study found that
dissatisfaction with the system and traditional politics is high almost everywhere. Globally, 70% agree that their
economy is rigged in favour of the rich and powerful, and 60% agree that traditional parties and politicians don’t care
about people like them.

### The Second Amendment Paradox

The United States of America (USA) provides a prime example of how the well intended ideals of the founding fathers of introducing
the Second Amendment to the Constitution has now taken a very sinister turn. The Second Amendment was introduced to protect
the young nation, in 1791, from the abuse of a tyrannical external governments i.e. United Kingdom & France. However, in the 21st century
the citizens of the country are now being terrorised by the very government that was originally created to protect them, and they fear the
removal of their Second Amendment rights will lead to persecution from their own government.

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a *free state*, the right of the people to keep and bear
arms, shall not be infringed.

::citation
[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-2/)
::

The second amendment was introduced with the intent of defending America not just from external forces, but from corrupt
and tyrannical forces from within. The founding fathers of the United States of America were very aware of the dangers of
centralised power and the potential for corruption and abuse of power.  

The result of this is that the citizens of the USA are now living in a state of perpetual fear of their own government,
that by disarming themselves would only invite tyranny. The result of which is that Americans now find themselves embroiled
in paradox that in order to protect their freedom they have to give up their freedom, or put in another way in order to
prevent the murder of Americans they have to tolerate the murder of Americans.

There is no easy solution to this problem, and ironically trying to solve the problem using the root cause of the problem 
in the first place, the government is a dilemma in itself.

### Getting to the root

The root cause of many of the problems in the world today primarily stem from governments, and the over extended reach of 
the state into the lives of its citizens. This has resulted in the *state* becoming the new religion, and the people they 
were supposedly created to serve to become the slaves.

The sole intention of the state is not to serve, but it is to drive its population further into debt and serfdom, to the benefit of
the *elite* which has been the case for thousands of years.

### The Democracy delusion

For centuries states have tried to appease the population by offering them a concept that they choose to call *Democracy*
whereby every few years the citizens get to elect their political representatives in the vain hope that they may support 
and supposedly *fight* for their constituents. The fact is that these representatives just end up disappearing into the 
orgy of centralised planning disaster zones that are called Parliaments, and are then forced or what is commonly referred
to as *whipped* to serve the aims and whims of the *party*.

On the rare occasion that a representative breaks ranks and chooses to vote against the *party* it may make the early evening 
news cycle but will soon be covered by a new scandal to serve as a distraction.

The electorate is lulled into the security of the supposed *Group Think* fiasco which is often referred to as the *Party Manifesto*
which touted as the Mandate of the party and the choice of the people.  However, in reality nobody ever agrees on anything
contained in the Manifesto from the electorate to the party members.  In most cases, Manifestos only contain loosely related words
that may form vague concepts and no real measurable benefits.

Why is it that people across the globe continue to delude themselves that systems of voting, government and centralised planning
are fit for purpose, in the digital and modern age?

### The fallacy of Nationhood

Often the refrain of the elected party to power that their rise to the position of power is the choice of the people, 
are then supposedly to identify themselves as a nation, all believing and identifying with some supposed national traits.

This *Nationalism* is supposed to mean an expression of identity that invokes,  glorifies, a deep and abiding connection
between individuals of the *nation* that informs, complements, and often transcends other identities rooted in 
religious belief and affiliation, class imperatives, gender roles, and regional affinities. 

We are supposedly lead to believe that a Nation, is group or collection of people sharing a common immutable ethnicity, 
shared language, history, bloodline, culture, character, habits, traditions, customs and manners. 

The modern state, in order to attain a degree of cultural homogeneity to permit political heterogeneity, had 
to condense sufficient cultural power to make the act of coercion relatively risk-free. Sections of the population 
regarded as posing a potential risk had to be made to conform to a state-driven and elite-driven model of cultural and 
moral normality. 

The state, has taken over the normative goal-setting that religion had previously performed. In exchange, 
citizenship offers access to political power and *freedoms*.

When all is said and done the only real use case of Nationalism is primarily for the *Othering* of the outsiders and to 
foster the fear of them. Driving groups to believe that they are all the same because they share common characteristics
and the others that do not share these are for the most part cannot be trusted for their only wish is to destroy or steal.

Modern politics has done nothing more than to descend to quagmire of *Culture Wars* among its own *nation* and attempts to
paint those that do not believe or conform to views as *traitors*

::quote 
  Weakened by the challenge of technology, the state will treat increasingly autonomous individuals, its former citizens,
 with the same ruthlessness and diplomacy is has heretofore displayed in its dealings with other governments.

True *patriotism* is defined as a generous love and true affection for ones country, but unfortunately in politics the 
pretended *Patriotism* is used as nothing more as a cloak for self-interest and greed.

When one professes love for ones country, what exactly are the things you love about the country?  Is it the exact 
geographic coordinates that the country is situated in?  Is it the soil? is it the grass that only grows within the 
geographic area?

The reality is that the country is nothing more than a collection of people, who have been born and raised in a specific
geographic area, who have been indoctrinated into a supposed set of beliefs, values and traditions.  The country is
nothing more than the people who live in it, and the people who live in it are nothing more than the country.

The United Kingdom is a prime example of this, where the people of the United Kingdom are supposedly to be proud to be 
British, but what exactly does that mean?  As child of Welsh parents who emigrated to South Africa, where I was born and 
raised, I was left confused for years when I asked my Dad if we were British, and he said no we are Welsh, we are never
British.  

Despite, living and growing up in South Africa, I always had a strong sense of being Welsh, and I am still very proud of
my Welsh heritage.  I have since read a lot of history about Wales, and the Welsh people, and  I do visit Wales often, 
as now live in England.  

My own personal irony is that although I am supposedly a British citizen, I have always had a British passport, I live in
England, have English Wife and Kids, have strong affiliation with Wales, and I am a Welsh Rugby supporter, pay my taxes and vote,
I am still not considered to be British, because most people identify me as a South African.

The reality is that I am not British, I am not Welsh, I am not South African, I am not English, I do not necessarily identify
as a citizen of any country, I am just a human being, who happens to live in England, and I am proud of my Welsh heritage.

In many respects the words of my father still ring true in my ear, Internally I am Welsh, but externally I am South African, 
and therefore I am not British. 

There are also many things I am not. 
* I am not a patriot
* I am not a nationalist
* I am not a citizen
* I am not a subject
* I am not a slave
* I am not a consumer
* I am not a voter
* I am not a taxpayer
* I am not a number
* I am not a statistic
* I am not a label
* I am not a product
* I am not a resource
* I am not a commodity
* I am not a human resource
* I am not human capital
* I am not a human asset
* I am not human capital stock
* I am not a human capital resource
* I am not an employee

The only thing I truly identify as would be a *Sovereign Individual*. Everything else is just a label, a construct to
indicate that you are owned by the system and exploited by the system.

### Failing education

The education system has been designed to indoctrinate the population into *the system* and to ensure that they are 
suitably trained to be able to perform the tasks that are required of them.  The *education system* is not designed to
encourage free thinking, creativity, innovation, or to encourage the students to question the status quo.  

The primary focus of the *education system* is to ensure that the students are able to pass the exams, supposedly to 
ensure that they are able to get a job in order to pay taxes.  It's sole purpose from the outset is to ensure that the 
students are able to conform to the system, ensuring that the students are able to be good consumers, compliant citizens.

The education system has now evolved into a system that has is specifically designed to ensure the enslavement of the
future generations by the system.  Taking these points into context, then it should be apparent that the education system
is not actually failing it is achieve its primary objective, it's just that the people are not aware of the true purpose.

When the Education system was originally devised industries needed workers with a relatively fixed set of skills and 
knowledge. However, today this idea is rapidly losing relevance in an era where innovation, disruption and constant 
change, adaptability and learning agility are most needed.

The current education system, built on the Industrial Revolution model, which focused on IQ, in particular memorization
and standardization – skills that will be easily and efficiently supplanted by artificial and augmented intelligence (AI)
, where IQ alone isn’t sufficient. 

To succeed future generations will need a complementary mix of the following 3 components to reach their potential:
* IQ (intelligence) 
* EQ (emotional intelligence) 
* RQ (resilience) 

Governments across the globe purport that the consequences of leaving school early,  at the individual level are
primarily linked to unemployment, social exclusion, poverty, poor physical and mental health and lower life expectancy,
and *low participation in democratic institutions and initiatives*. More broadly, these outcomes are associated with 
poor economic growth and high economic and social costs.

1. Personal Challenges, which the child is born with, acquires or experiences;
2. Family Circumstances, such as living in a low-income or workless household, familial support and values around education
3. Social Relationships, which refer to relational challenges brought about through all types of relationships outside 
of the family, including with teachers, employers and peers;
4. Institutional Features of the School/Work-Place, such as spatial aspects, organisational policies, institutional 
norms, expectations and available resources;
5. Structural Factors, including local and national economic challenges, national policies and challenges of the educational system.

Centralisation, for example, requires teachers to adhere to prescribed curricula that may not be aligned with students’ 
interests, learning needs or aspirations. Research shows that the school environment and infrastructure play a powerful 
role in facilitating student engagement and that inappropriate teaching and 
assessment strategies, resources, and available learning support greatly impact on student’s self-esteem, contributing 
in many cases to school dropout. 

An overly centralised education system may also impact on students’ sense of a lack of agency as they lack choice and 
flexibility to direct their own learning paths, which could lead those at risk of EL to become disengaged and 
potentially drop out.

Throughout the average students education period of between 12 and 16 years, the student is subjected to a constant
stream of propaganda, which is designed to ensure that the student is indoctrinated into the system.  Almost every ounce
of innovation and creativity is mentally beaten out of the student, and the student is forced to conform to the system.

On the face of it is nothing short of a miracle that any entrepreneurs have escaped this indoctrination process, and have actually 
succeeded. For the entrepreneurs that have succeeded one will inevitably find that they have had to unlearn everything
and the vast majority either dropped out or never went to university.  The vast majority have shown the will and drive 
to succeed in spite of the system, and not because of it.
