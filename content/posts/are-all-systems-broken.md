Over the past few decades there has been a lot of talk about the *system* being broken. Some may say that the system 
has never worked.  The reality the system has only ever worked for a few and is continually being used to exploit the 
many.

Over the past 2 decades it has become abundantly clear that the system is broken beyond repair now. The only way forward
is to burn it down and start again. All the ideals, traditions, beliefs, values and sensibilities that have all been used
to justify the system are now for the most part obsolete and only small percentage of the population still identify
and relate to them. 

Our systems of Government, Education, Finance, Religion, Media, Science, Medicine, Law, Politics, Business, Agriculture
have all been modified manipulated and corrupted to serve the few at the expense of the many, resulting that they now
no longer have the effects that any of the originators intended.

The United States of America (USA) provides a prime example of how the well intended ideals of the founding fathers of introducing
the Second Amendment to the Constitution has now taken a very sinister turn. The Second Amendment was introduced to protect
the young nation, in 1791, from the tyranny of a tyrannical external governments i.e. United Kingdom & France. However, in the 21st century
the citizens of the country are now being terrorised by the very government that was created to protect them, and they fear the
removal of their Second Amendment rights will lead to persecution from their own government.

The root cause of many of the problems in the world today primarily stem from governments, and the over extended reach of 
the state into the lives of its citizens. This has resulted in the *state* becoming the new religion, and the people they 
were supposedly created to serve to become the slaves.

The sole intention of the state is not to serve, but it is to drive its population further into debt and serfdom, to the benefit of
the *elite* which has been the case for thousands of years.

### The Democracy delusion

For centuries states have tried to appease the population by offering them a concept that they choose to call *Democracy*
whereby every few years the citizens get to elect their political representatives in the vain hope that they may support 
and supposedly *fight* for their constituents. The fact is that these representatives just end up disappearing into the 
orgy of centralised planning disaster zones that are called Parliaments, and are then forced or what is commonly referred
to as *whipped* to serve the aims and whims of the *party*.

On the rare occasion that a representative breaks ranks and chooses to vote against the *party* it may make the early evening 
news cycle but will soon be covered by a new scandal to serve as a distraction.

The electorate is lulled into the security of the supposed Group Think fiasco which is often referred to as the *Party Manifesto*
which touted as the Mandate of the party and the choice of the people.  However, in reality nobody ever agrees on anything
contained in the Manifesto from the electorate to the party members.  In most cases, Manifestos only contain loosely related words
that may form vague concepts and no real measurable benefits.

Why is it that people across the globe continue to delude themselves that systems of voting, government and centralised planning
are fit for purpose, in the digital and modern age?

### The fallacy of Nationhood

Often the refrain of the elected party to power that their rise to the position of power is the choice of the people, 
are then supposedly to identify themselves as a nation, all believing and identifying with some supposed national traits.

This *Nationalism* is supposed to mean an expression of identity that invokes,  glorifies, a deep and abiding connection
between individuals of the *nation* that informs, complements, and often transcends other identities rooted in 
religious belief and affiliation, class imperatives, gender roles, and regional affinities. 

We are supposedly lead to believe that a Nation, is group or collection of people sharing a common immutable ethnicity, 
shared language, history, bloodline, culture, character, habits, traditions, customs and manners. 

The modern state, in order to attain a degree of cultural homogeneity to permit political heterogeneity, had 
to condense sufficient cultural power to make the act of coercion relatively risk-free. Sections of the population 
regarded as posing a potential risk had to be made to conform to a state-driven and elite-driven model of cultural and 
moral normality. 

The state, has taken over the normative goal-setting that religion had previously performed. In exchange, 
citizenship offers access to political power and *freedoms*.

When all is said and done the only real use case of Nationalism is primarily for the *Othering* of the outsiders and to 
foster the fear of them. Driving groups to believe that they are all the same because they share common characteristics
and the others that do not share these are for the most part cannot be trusted for their only wish is to destroy or steal.

Modern politics has done nothing more than to descend to quagmire of *Culture Wars* among its own *nation* and attempts to
paint those that do not believe or conform to views as *traitors*

> Patriotism is the Last Refuge of the Scoundrel
>

True *patriotism* is defined as a generous love and true affection for ones country, but unfortunately in politics the 
pretended *Patriotism* is used as nothing more as a cloak for self-interest and greed.

When one professes love for ones country, what exactly are the things you love about the country?  Is it the exact 
geographic coordinates that the country is situated in?  Is it the soil? is it the grass that only grows within the 
geographic area?

The reality is that the country is nothing more than a collection of people, who have been born and raised in a specific
geographic area, who have been indoctrinated into a supposed set of beliefs, values and traditions.  The country is
nothing more than the people who live in it, and the people who live in it are nothing more than the country.

### Failing education

The education system has been designed to indoctrinate the population into the *system* and to ensure that they are 
suitably trained to be able to perform the tasks that are required of them.  The education system is not designed to
encourage free thinking, creativity, innovation, or to encourage the students to question the status quo.  

The education system is designed to ensure that the students are able to pass the exams, supposedly to ensure that they 
are able to get a job in order to pay taxes.  It's sole purpose from the outset is to ensure that the students are 
able to conform to the system, ensuring that the students are able to be good consumers, compliant citizens.

The education system has now evolved into a system that has is specifically designed to ensure the enslavemnt of the
future generations by the system.
